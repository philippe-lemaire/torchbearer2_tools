traits = {
    "Adventurous": "Most folks are content to live a quiet life at home, but some fools actually crave the excitement of a rollicking adventure. They live to travel to strange places and experience new things. It can be hard to grind an adventurous spirit down—they’re always ready to see what’s over the next hill—but sometimes they jump into a situation without looking.",
    "Bitter": "Some turn bitter in their travels and grow to feel all their efforts are for nothing. This bitterness may protect them from the many and varied disappointments of life as an adventurer, but it also burdens them. They have trouble taking the optimistic course.",
    "Bold": "The bold rush to action without a thought for their own safety. Daring stratagems and reckless abandon are hallmarks of the bold. Forethought and caution are not for these souls.",
    "Born of Earth and Stone": "Dwarves were shaped by their maker from the bones of the earth, and they share many qualities with earth and stone. Dwarves are steadfast and sturdy in all things, with a special feel for metal and stone, but they can also be stubborn and unyielding.",
    "Brave": "The brave never hesitate to step into the unknown, but they are susceptible to wild tales of far-off places and dangerous adventures.",
    "Calm": "Calm souls are difficult to anger and easily shrug off any emotion that does manage to burden their heart. However, they risk becoming too sedate and perhaps missing a threat.",
    "Cunning": "The cunning are adept at deceit and at plotting traps. They are often arrogant and underestimate their opponents.",
    "Curious": "Curious sorts are always eager to learn and are on the lookout for the new or the mysterious. But there are many tales of those whose curiosity led them and their friends to an abrupt and violent end.",
    "Defender": "Monsters and villains are a fact of life in the wide world. Many are the townsfolk who have been called upon to defend their homes without training, support or even proper equipment. These people know the value and cost of defending one’s home. Of course, when forced to choose, these defenders often put their home above other concerns.",
    "Early Riser": "Early risers are up first in the morning. Awake before the sun, they’re clear-headed and sharp while everyone is bleary-eyed and sleepy. Of course, they must be early to bed to be so early to rise.",
    "Extravagant": "Some folks have expensive tastes and spend profligately. They’re experts at grand gestures but sometimes find it difficult to show restraint when required.",
    "Extrovert": "Extroverts love meeting people or introducing themselves to strangers. However, they often lead public or semipublic lives and are easy to track down, even when they don’t want to be found.",
    "Fearless": "Fearless fighters hold their ground in the face of unimaginable danger. However, they often put valor before discretion even in delicate matters.",
    "Fiery": "Fiery souls know how to stir up a crowd, but they are quick to anger.",
    "First Born": "Elves were the first to awake to the world and wandered beneath the stars long before the coming of dwarves or men. The trees and the stars recognize them as kin, and they are often possessed of special insight that comes from their memories of the dawn of the world. But their long lives can often move them to ponder consequences too deeply.",
    "Foolhardy": "There are some folks who are always going where they shouldn’t and doing what they mustn’t—sticking their heads in holes or reading strange, eldritch texts. Remarkably, some manage to skirt the consequences of their actions. But that may be because few people write stories about dead foolhardy adventurers.",
    "Generous": "Generous souls always seem to have something to give to others, even if it means going without themselves.",
    "Heart of Battle": "Warriors are creatures of action, able to throw their bodies into harm’s way with skill and valor in pursuit of their goals. But often warriors too readily resort to violence when another way might serve them better.",
    "Hidden Depths": "On the surface, halflings may appear to be a naive and unassuming people, but they have hidden depths of will and character. They bear up remarkably well against pain, fatigue and despair that would cause other peoples to break. Sometimes the hidden depths refers to their stomachs needing to be filled with cheese and beer.",
    "Honorable": "Some are known throughout the land for their upstanding character and peerless integrity. But those who stand tallest are ripe for the greatest fall. Honor does not ensure survival.",
    "Jaded": "The adventuring life hardens some and makes them callous. This disposition protects them from the folly of youthful ideals and heroism, but it also makes them dismissive of new ideas.",
    "Loner": "Loners have trouble working well with others. They’re at their best when no one knows what they’re up to. Sometimes, of course, they get in over their heads and could really use a helping hand.",
    "Lost": "Hard to believe, but there are those among us who have no sense of direction. They’re useless at orienteering, but conversely their wandering treks make them difficult to track down.",
    "Quick-Witted": "Quick-witted adventurers act on instinct, without need for thought or consideration. While this attribute is clearly useful, it can lead to difficulties when patience and planning are required.",
    "Quiet": "Some people are quiet in everything they do—the way they speak, the way they work and the way they walk. Some sink so far into quietude that they have difficulty coming out of their shells.",
    "Rough Hands": "A hard life of toil toughens the hands. Such hands mark them as working folk, which can cause them to disdain those who pursue softer arts.",
    "Scarred": "Survivors of terrible wars are often scarred by their experiences. They’re tough and not easily flustered by injury or fear, but they are also maimed or traumatized by their experiences.",
    "Sharp-Eyed": "Sharp-eyed adventurers are always welcome in a party. They make good scouts or hunters, but sometimes, after staring at the brush for days on end, they can get a little jumpy.",
    "Skeptical": "Skeptical souls are always watching for lies and deceit—a good quality— but they can go too far when the skeptic thinks even the truthful are liars.",
    "Skinny": "It’s always good to keep a slim build to fit through tight squeezes, but it’s easy for the thin to get tossed around in a fight.",
    "Steady Hands": "Criminals, smiths and other craftsmen who create fine or delicate work are often known for their steady hands. These sorts can become fearful of damaging these wondrous instruments.",
    "Stoic": "Stoic souls never complain about the hardships of life on the road. They accept them and soldier on. However, this same quality can make them emotionally remote and difficult to reach in matters of empathy, love and compassion.",
    "Tall": "Some folks are unusually straight and tall. It’s a notable attribute that grants a longer reach, but it can be trouble when snaking one’s way through narrow tunnels in a dungeon.",
    "Thoughtful": "Thoughtful adventurers will ponder all options and all possible courses of action before making a decision. This is very useful when there’s time to plan or ponder but useless in times of haste.",
    "Touched by the Gods": "The Immortals speak through theurges. Moreover, when a theurge speaks to the Immortals, the Immortals are often willing to listen. The gods guide and protect their chosen, but theurges must be ever vigilant to ensure that the words they speak are truly those of the Immortals and not the secret desires of their own hearts.",
    "Wizard’s Sight": "Magicians see more than other mortals. Whether it’s the telltale signs of a spirit or demon or the flicker of a lie in a person’s aura, magicians can see the flow of magic and the misty borders of the Otherworld. But they must also take care, for that which is seen with the Wizard’s Sight cannot be unseen.",
