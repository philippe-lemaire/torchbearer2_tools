traits = {
    "Adventurous": "Most folks are content to live a quiet life at home, but some fools actually crave the excitement of a rollicking adventure. They live to travel to strange places and experience new things. It can be hard to grind an adventurous spirit down—they’re always ready to see what’s over the next hill—but sometimes they jump into a situation without looking.",
    "Bitter": "Some turn bitter in their travels and grow to feel all their efforts are for nothing. This bitterness may protect them from the many and varied disappointments of life as an adventurer, but it also burdens them. They have trouble taking the optimistic course.",
    "Bold": "The bold rush to action without a thought for their own safety. Daring stratagems and reckless abandon are hallmarks of the bold. Forethought and caution are not for these souls.",
    "Born of Earth and Stone": "Dwarves were shaped by their maker from the bones of the earth, and they share many qualities with earth and stone. Dwarves are steadfast and sturdy in all things, with a special feel for metal and stone, but they can also be stubborn and unyielding.",
    "Brave": "The brave never hesitate to step into the unknown, but they are susceptible to wild tales of far-off places and dangerous adventures.",
    "Calm": "Calm souls are difficult to anger and easily shrug off any emotion that does manage to burden their heart. However, they risk becoming too sedate and perhaps missing a threat.",
    "Cunning": "The cunning are adept at deceit and at plotting traps. They are often arrogant and underestimate their opponents.",
    "Curious": "Curious sorts are always eager to learn and are on the lookout for the new or the mysterious. But there are many tales of those whose curiosity led them and their friends to an abrupt and violent end.",
    "Defender": "Monsters and villains are a fact of life in the wide world. Many are the townsfolk who have been called upon to defend their homes without training, support or even proper equipment. These people know the value and cost of defending one’s home. Of course, when forced to choose, these defenders often put their home above other concerns.",
    "Early Riser": "Early risers are up first in the morning. Awake before the sun, they’re clear-headed and sharp while everyone is bleary-eyed and sleepy. Of course, they must be early to bed to be so early to rise.",
    "Extravagant": "Some folks have expensive tastes and spend profligately. They’re experts at grand gestures but sometimes find it difficult to show restraint when required.",
    "Extrovert": "Extroverts love meeting people or introducing themselves to strangers. However, they often lead public or semipublic lives and are easy to track down, even when they don’t want to be found.",
    "Fearless": "Fearless fighters hold their ground in the face of unimaginable danger. However, they often put valor before discretion even in delicate matters.",
    "Fiery": "Fiery souls know how to stir up a crowd, but they are quick to anger.",
    "First Born": "Elves were the first to awake to the world and wandered beneath the stars long before the coming of dwarves or men. The trees and the stars recognize them as kin, and they are often possessed of special insight that comes from their memories of the dawn of the world. But their long lives can often move them to ponder consequences too deeply.",
    "Foolhardy": "There are some folks who are always going where they shouldn’t and doing what they mustn’t—sticking their heads in holes or reading strange, eldritch texts. Remarkably, some manage to skirt the consequences of their actions. But that may be because few people write stories about dead foolhardy adventurers.",
    "Generous": "Generous souls always seem to have something to give to others, even if it means going without themselves.",
    "Heart of Battle": "Warriors are creatures of action, able to throw their bodies into harm’s way with skill and valor in pursuit of their goals. But often warriors too readily resort to violence when another way might serve them better.",
    "Hidden Depths": "On the surface, halflings may appear to be a naive and unassuming people, but they have hidden depths of will and character. They bear up remarkably well against pain, fatigue and despair that would cause other peoples to break. Sometimes the hidden depths refers to their stomachs needing to be filled with cheese and beer.",
    "Honorable": "Some are known throughout the land for their upstanding character and peerless integrity. But those who stand tallest are ripe for the greatest fall. Honor does not ensure survival.",
    "Jaded": "The adventuring life hardens some and makes them callous. This disposition protects them from the folly of youthful ideals and heroism, but it also makes them dismissive of new ideas.",
    "Loner": "Loners have trouble working well with others. They’re at their best when no one knows what they’re up to. Sometimes, of course, they get in over their heads and could really use a helping hand.",
    "Lost": "Hard to believe, but there are those among us who have no sense of direction. They’re useless at orienteering, but conversely their wandering treks make them difficult to track down.",
    "Quick-Witted": "Quick-witted adventurers act on instinct, without need for thought or consideration. While this attribute is clearly useful, it can lead to difficulties when patience and planning are required.",
    "Quiet": "Some people are quiet in everything they do—the way they speak, the way they work and the way they walk. Some sink so far into quietude that they have difficulty coming out of their shells.",
    "Rough Hands": "A hard life of toil toughens the hands. Such hands mark them as working folk, which can cause them to disdain those who pursue softer arts.",
    "Scarred": "Survivors of terrible wars are often scarred by their experiences. They’re tough and not easily flustered by injury or fear, but they are also maimed or traumatized by their experiences.",
    "Sharp-Eyed": "Sharp-eyed adventurers are always welcome in a party. They make good scouts or hunters, but sometimes, after staring at the brush for days on end, they can get a little jumpy.",
    "Skeptical": "Skeptical souls are always watching for lies and deceit—a good quality— but they can go too far when the skeptic thinks even the truthful are liars.",
    "Skinny": "It’s always good to keep a slim build to fit through tight squeezes, but it’s easy for the thin to get tossed around in a fight.",
    "Steady Hands": "Criminals, smiths and other craftsmen who create fine or delicate work are often known for their steady hands. These sorts can become fearful of damaging these wondrous instruments.",
    "Stoic": "Stoic souls never complain about the hardships of life on the road. They accept them and soldier on. However, this same quality can make them emotionally remote and difficult to reach in matters of empathy, love and compassion.",
    "Tall": "Some folks are unusually straight and tall. It’s a notable attribute that grants a longer reach, but it can be trouble when snaking one’s way through narrow tunnels in a dungeon.",
    "Thoughtful": "Thoughtful adventurers will ponder all options and all possible courses of action before making a decision. This is very useful when there’s time to plan or ponder but useless in times of haste.",
    "Touched by the Gods": "The Immortals speak through theurges. Moreover, when a theurge speaks to the Immortals, the Immortals are often willing to listen. The gods guide and protect their chosen, but theurges must be ever vigilant to ensure that the words they speak are truly those of the Immortals and not the secret desires of their own hearts.",
    "Wizard’s Sight": "Magicians see more than other mortals. Whether it’s the telltale signs of a spirit or demon or the flicker of a lie in a person’s aura, magicians can see the flow of magic and the misty borders of the Otherworld. But they must also take care, for that which is seen with the Wizard’s Sight cannot be unseen.",
    # from the lore master's guide
    "Alert": "Adventurers with this trait know to remain alert for monsters and other dangers when out in the wild lands. Those who take this behavior too far have been known to become paranoid and skittish.",
    "Between Two Worlds": "Shamans always have one foot in this world and another in the Otherworld. They are the intermediaries between mortals and spirits, between civilized folk and the perilous wilds. This fluidity allows them to see details that would escape mundane eyes, but it also means that they’re distracted by the wonders and demands of the spirit world.",
    "Bodyguard": "Bodyguards are trained to protect their charges from harm, danger and exposure. They are often a valuable asset, but they can become overprotective and hinder or impede the one they are protecting.",
    "Cautious": "Cautious people know that strangers don’t always have the best intentions and that things aren’t always what they seem. They tend to think before they act and test before they trust. Sometimes their caution leads them to let opportunities pass them by.",
    "Clever": "Clever adventurers are adept at figuring out answers to pernicious problems. However, taverns are rife with tales of clever adventurers who were too smart for their own good.",
    "Compassionate": "Compassionate adventurers are able to see and understand a problem from their opponent’s viewpoint. This is a great benefit in many situations, but it makes things difficult when ruthless action is called for.",
    "Conservative": "Conservative folk hold to traditional attitudes and values. They are confident when dealing with the familiar, but they feel lost or uncertain when dealing with the unfamiliar.",
    "Cynical": "Cynical people believe everyone acts out of their own self-interest, regardless of what they say. Cynical people can be hard to fool and are capable of doing what it takes to achieve their ends without remorse (because others would do the same if the roles were reversed). They tend to find it difficult to believe or trust anyone.",
    "Defiant": "Defiant people boldly resist authority or power of any sort. They don’t let themselves be intimidated or forced to do things they don’t want to do. Sometimes they resist for the sake of resisting, even when going along would be in their best interest.",
    "Desperate": "Desperate people feel trapped when in hopeless circumstances. This feeling pushes them to face risks unimaginable to others because they feel they have no choice, but they’re also prone to taking rash or violent measures because they can’t see the larger picture.",
    "Determined": "Determined adventurers focus their energies on accomplishing their goals. While this is a useful characteristic, it can turn from determination to tunnel vision.",
    "Devil May Care": "Thieves take risks despite the long odds, gambling that they’ll dodge whatever danger fate throws at them. This attitude often leads them to undertake foolish gambits merely to prove a point.",
    "Driven": "Driven adventurers follow their beliefs no matter the cost. However, if they are not careful, that cost can prove to be very dear.",
    "Emaciated": "Some religious adherents believe that food is a pollutant to the body, and thus they only eat what is strictly necessary. They do not feel the pangs of hunger as acutely as others, but such deprivation can sap their strength in desperate moments.",
    "Fearful": "There is an adage common among many adventurers, “A fearful adventurer is a wise adventurer.” In other words, it’s better to flee a potential danger than wait around to be surprised. Of course, this instinct preserves adventurers who travel in dangerous areas, but it hurts them when they come into the more civilized towns and have to deal with polite society.",
    "Graceful": "Some adventurers possess poise and grace like unto a stalking cat.  However, grace can be confused for competence, leading the graceful to overestimate their talents.",
    "Huldrekall": "Huldrekall are troll changelings left to be raised by human parents, sometimes as punishment, sometimes in exchange for a human child stolen. In their human form, they are beautiful to behold (though most have a telltale tail). In their troll form, they are hideous, long-nosed and misshapen.",
    "Hungry": "Some people are wracked by a gnawing hunger. They never seem to get enough. They’re always thinking about their next meal, which can help them keep track of where there’s food to be found. However, sometimes they eat more than their fair share or get distracted by a rumbling belly at inopportune times.",
    "Independent": "Some folk have strong, independent spirits. They are most clear- headed when free from the judgment of parents, monarchs and priests.  However, they all too often ignore advice on principle rather than on its merits.",
    "Innocent": "Innocent adventurers have an honesty and simplicity about them that makes their requests difficult to deny. However, they are often naive to the world’s true nature.",
    "Jovial": "Jovial folk are always good-natured and convivial. They can be a joy to be around and are capable of eliciting smiles from the most dedicated curmudgeons, but they struggle to contain their mirth when the situation requires a more serious, somber attitude.",
    "Juvenile": "This adventurer, no matter their actual age, is vigorous and youthful.  They rarely get tired or sick. However, this youthful exuberance comes with a youthful impatience and a terrible sense of humor.",
    "Keen Ear": "A keen ear is a useful quality for adventurers, but it can make them susceptible to loud noises and the general din of the big cities.",
    "Leader": "Rarely, a leader emerges from the ranks of the adventuring parties.  They have qualities that inspire people to listen to them, even when they speak softly or indirectly. But they must resist temptation to abuse their power and turn from servant to tyrant.",
    "Loyal": "Loyal people remain faithful and true through all hardships. However, that faithfulness can make them vulnerable to betrayal and encourage them to overlook faults in the object of their loyalty.",
    "Natural Bearings": "Those with natural bearings always seem to know where they are, but knowing where you are is not the same as knowing where you should be.",
    "Night Owl": "Certain adventurers maintain nocturnal habits. When others are asleep, they’re awake and prowling about, clear-headed and sharp-eyed. Of course, come noontime the next day, you’ll find them fast asleep.",
    "Nimble": "Nimble adventurers are adept at leaping and climbing. When out of the spotlight, though, they can be just as clumsy as everyone else, if not more so.",
    "Opportunistic": "Some folk are quick to adapt their actions based on what is expedient or effective, regardless of ethical principles. They’re great at seizing the moment, but friends and comrades are frequently disgusted by the choices they make.",
    "Pragmatic": "Pragmatic folk are practical and sensible, dealing in concrete facts rather than theories. They’re good at cutting to the heart of the matter and making plans, but they have a tendency to feel out of their depth when faced with the inexplicable.",
    "Restless": "Some people are unable to relax. They always have to be moving or doing. They are excellent at starting new projects and investing all their energy in the new enterprise, but they also easily become bored or anxious. They don’t often have the patience to see things through to completion.",
    "Rotund": "Rich living can make some people stout or even a bit portly. These people have an air of prosperity and a cushion against the rigors of life in the wild. However, they may have trouble squeezing through tight spaces.",
    "Rover": "Rovers find it difficult to stay in one place for any length of time. They’ve been every place once or twice and are experts of life on the road.  However, their reluctance to put down roots can make them blind to the bonds that tie communities together.",
    "Short": "Some adventurers are shorter than others. They are particularly adept at slipping through cracks and getting into hard-to-reach places, but of course, they have a difficult time getting the plates and jars out of the cupboard.",
    "Skittish": "Some people are prone to simply shy or start. Their nervous manner means they are often darting away before most others recognize danger has arrived. They will even jump at their own shadows.",
    "Stout": "Some adventurers are stout and sturdy. They are not easily pushed around and can throw their weight behind their blows, but they often overestimate their own strength.",
    "Stubborn": "Stubborn adventurers refuse to give an inch, no matter what. However, they often refuse to admit they’re wrong and pick bad hills to die on.",
    "Suspicious": "Suspicious adventurers are always on the lookout for plots and schemes.  Of course, they’re also much more prone to seeing a plot even when there is none.",
    "Tough": "Some adventurers are built tougher than others. They’re better at coping with injury and sickness, but this quality also leads to a certain hubris.  Their reserves are not infinite, and they often push themselves past their limits.",
    "Voice of Thunder": "Skalds can project their voices across bustling halls and tumultuous battlefields. They pride themselves on their elocution, but at times they seem to be in love with the sound of their own words.",
    "Weather Sense": "Some adventurers are born with an innate sense of the weather—they feel it in their bones. Of course, those creaking bones can cause their limbs to ache at inopportune moments.",
    "Wise": "Wisdom is a rare thing in this day and age. Wise adventurers carry the ability to see truth and the right path to action, but they must constantly fight their own inner demons lest that wisdom turn to arrogance and pride.",
